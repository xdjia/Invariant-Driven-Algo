# Invariant-Driven-Algorithms

## Overview

**Invariant-Driven-Algorithms** is a collection of algorithm problems explored through the lens of **invariant-based reasoning**. The goal is to not only solve problems but to understand the deeper properties (invariants) that guide the solution. The repository includes:
- Python implementations for rapid prototyping.
- Use of **LLMs** (Language Models) for generating insights and alternative solutions.
- Formal verification using **Lean**, facilitated by tools like **LeanDojo**.

## Why Invariants?
Invariants are conditions that remain true throughout the execution of an algorithm. Identifying the correct invariants can lead to:
- Simplified problem-solving.
- Robust and error-free solutions.
- Better understanding of edge cases and correctness.
